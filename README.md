## Analysis and Comparison of CO2 Emissions Per Capita Across the World
As someone who is concerned about the changes happening to the global climate right now, I wanted to learn more about the origins of climate change and analyze different CO2 emissions per capita on a world view, regional view, and a country view. The project is published online with animated graphs here: <https://kayleemo.shinyapps.io/final-app/>
