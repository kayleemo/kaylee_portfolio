## Analysis and Comparison of CO2 Emissions Per Capita Across the World
As someone who is concerned about the changes happening to the global climate right now, I wanted to learn more about the origins of climate change and analyze different CO2 emissions per capita on a world view, regional view, and a country view. The project is published online with animated graphs here: <https://kayleemo.shinyapps.io/final-app/>

## Predicting the Mid-Career Salary of Undergraduate Students
As I am nearing college graduation, I became curious about what, and if there are any, characteristics of colleges that lead to higher monetary returns (salary) after four-years of university. I created a regression prroblem with multiple predictors to see if I could find a relationship between them and my response variable (mid-career salary).

## Predicting Credit Scores Based on Customer Credit Information and History
For this project, I wanted to see if I could create a reliable and accurate model that would accurately predict credit scores based on customer credit information and history, to provide lenders with a tool to make more informed decisions and help individuals secure better financial outcomes.
